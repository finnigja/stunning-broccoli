# stunning-broccoli

This repository contains [main.go](main.go), which is the code for an example program.

It also contains [build-attested-release.yml](.github/workflows/build-attested-release.yml), which is a GitHub workflow that checks out the code, builds cross-platform binaries, creates an archive containing the binaries, creates an attestation for that archive, and then publishes a release.

## Building a release

The workflow is configured to build when a new tag is pushed, with something like:
```
$ git tag v0.0.1 main -m "release v0.0.1"
$ git push origin tag v0.0.1
```

## Verifying the attestation

The release artifact binary can be downloaded and the the attestation verified using the `gh` client.

For example:
```
$ curl -sLO https://github.com/finnigja/stunning-broccoli/releases/download/93e64141/stunning-broccoli-93e64141.tar.gz
$ gh attestation verify ./stunning-broccoli-93e64141.tar.gz -o finnigja
