# stunning-broccoli

This repository contains [main.go](main.go), which is the code for an example program.

It also contains [build-attested-release.yml](.github/workflows/build-attested-release.yml), which is a GitHub workflow that checks out the code, builds cross-platform binaries, creates an archive containing the binaries, creates an attestation for that archive, and then publishes a release.

## Building a release

A build can be triggered by running the action as a workflow dispatch.

## Verifying the attestation

The release artifact binary can be downloaded and the the attestation verified using the `gh` client.

For example:
```
$ curl -sLO https://github.com/finnigja/stunning-broccoli/releases/download/f1350b67/stunning-broccoli-f1350b67.tar.gz
$ gh attestation verify ./stunning-broccoli-f1350b67.tar.gz -o finnigja
